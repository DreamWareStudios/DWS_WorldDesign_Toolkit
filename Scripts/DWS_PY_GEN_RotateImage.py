"""
This script is used to rotate PNG images by 180 degrees and save the rotated images with a new file name in the same directory where the original images are located.

This is usefull for heightmap processing before importing them in Unreal Engine, as we need to flip the Y tiles in TerreSculptor before export, this mean that the tiles are effectively reversed, this script compensate for that.

Only rotated tiles should be imported into Unreal Engine using World Partition system if possible.
